**Welcome to my digital playground!**

This website showcases projects I've tackled during my studies, pushing my skills in web development.

Dive into a mix of individual and collaborative projects to see how I approach challenges and bring ideas to life. 
From concept to code, I've built this website entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is also my first deployment on Vercel, so extra points for bravery!
